R shiny app to interact with COVID-19 GWAS QTL colocalization results


Since the beginning of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection and its disease, COVID-19, have caused the largest contemporary pandemic to date. While many efforts are being devoted to the characterization of the genetic architecture of COVID-19 effect on human host, its underlying molecular basis has not been exhaustively explored across multiple molecular layers. To understand host response and to prioritize treatment targets, we sought to identify human genes influencing genetically-driven disease risk and severity. To this end, we performed ancestry-aware, trans-layer, multi-omics analyses by integrating v7 (April 8, 2022) COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS data with functional maps and QTL catalogs.
